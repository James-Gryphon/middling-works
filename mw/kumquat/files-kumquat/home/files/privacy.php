    If you register an account, your email address is collected as part of the authentication process. This is useful for my security purposes because it slows down potential registrations from spambots and people who may want to register multiple accounts. It also allows you to reset your password, log in without a password, or receive other secret information that you may request during your time on the site.
    <p><span class='z3'><b>b) Authentication</b></span><br>
    Email addresses may be used for some features to verify a user's identity, if they choose not to register an account or provide a temporary username/password for the feature.</p>
    <p><span class='z3'><b>c) Subscriptions</b></span><br>
    If you choose to subscribe to a service (such as the gPress newsletter), emails relevant to that service will be sent to the email address you provide.</p>
    <p><span class='z3'><b>d) Security and Disciplinary Actions</b></span><br>
    Email addresses may be kept and used to help combat malicious or otherwise unwanted activity, e.g. by temporarily or permanently suspending access that comes from or is related to certain addresses.</p>
    <p><span class='z3'><b>e) Necessary Announcements</b></span><br>
    I may send emails to your address if the site or service as a whole has experienced some event that would concern users.</p>
    <p><span class='z3'><b>f) Moderative Action</b></span><br>
    I may send emails to your address if it is deemed necessary for moderative action. For example, if activity from your account violates rules or terms of the website, you may be warned and/or the issue discussed via this means.</p>
