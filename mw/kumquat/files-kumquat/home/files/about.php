As someone who grew up with dial-up internet, and who tends to believe that \"Less is more\", this trend bothers me. And as someone who has actually tried to work on some modern websites and seen how convoluted they tend to be, I'm persuaded there must be a better way.</p>
    
    <p>This website, and most others I make, are representative of that vision. They have the features I need, and the appearance I think websites should have. This tends to correlate with lower bandwidth costs, faster loading speeds, and soothing gorgeous grey backgrounds.</p>
