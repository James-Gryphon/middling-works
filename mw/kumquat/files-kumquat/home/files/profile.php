    The profile page is a page between pages: it doesn't contain anything highly useful itself, but it's full of links
    that allow you to interact with a person using different features.

    There are a few basic sections:
    1. The profile itself, including a few basic facts and the bio/blurb
    2. The messenger, which allows you to quick-send a message to this person
    3. The invite manager, which allows you to invite this member to things

    3.
    Although including a full 'create invite' page for every working feature on the site is a problem waiting to happen,
    it wouldn't be a problem to create 'quick link' support that sends you to the lobby page with the invite filled out
    already. This only needs an "il" get param.
