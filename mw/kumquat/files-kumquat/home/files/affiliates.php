It works likes this: promote Middling products, and if users pay after using your affiliate link or code, you get 20% of the proceeds.<br><br>
You're unlikely to get rich doing this, but you might get a few hundred or thousand dollars a year. Furthermore, I'll give a single free license or membership for a product to any account of your choice, so long as you have 3 or more active sales for that product.</p>");
