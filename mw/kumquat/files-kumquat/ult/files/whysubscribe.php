<li>It fills a niche. I've played Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (or, as we call it, ULT) for more than five years. It's a great game that deserves to be taken seriously, like Chess or Draughts. While Chess has an abundance of online resources, Ultimate is lacking them. Many ULT implementations only support one platform or another. Only some have had networked multiplayer, or supported a form of move notation. Just a few have game clocks. None of them, as far as I know, have supported matches. The turnover rate in this market is high; the norm seems to be that someone makes their version and never touches it again.<br><br>As a result of these limitations, I played games and matches on my own spreadsheets for years, but I always felt there was room to do better. Now I've made a service to do just that. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the best ULT implementation that has ever existed for human-to-human play. If a Chess site subscription is worth a few dollars, and ULT is a great game, like Chess, then an ULT site might be worth a few dollars a year too.</li><br>
<li>Your money is the best way to maintain the site. You might say, ‘Other sites are free’. Well, web services that don't charge their users are either subsidized - that is, the hosts make money by some other means, and spend some supporting the site - or they're getting advertising revenue. Neither of these things are true for me. Developing software is my attempt at making an honorable living, and while I might promote things I like and use, I have no interest in hawking products I don't care about, selling your information, or distracting you with pop-ups and mandatory video ads.</li><br>
<li>Because you know what you're getting and what you're paying. I'm not tricking you into paying more than you expected per month, or luring you into something on false pretenses. You have the information to count the cost and decide whether to pay it or not.</li>

<li>If you don't have the money. My rates aren't high, but if you're struggling to make ends meet, you probably don't need another subscription service.</li>
<li>If you don't play ULT. The trial mode is limited, but it'll show you if you like the game. If you won't play, don't pay.</li>
<li>If you play, but only occasionally or casually. You can benefit from many features without paying - virtually all of them, if you play with hosts who are members. It doesn't make sense to pay money for something that you don't use much, when the free option is good enough.</li>
<li>If you expect AI. AI is a weak point in my setup, the big thing that I don't have that you can get somewhere else. I hope to be able to remedy this, but we're not there yet.</li>
