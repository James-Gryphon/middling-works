Process of making a game
1. Decide if it's online, hotseat, or live
Online games involve online players from different computers, and you need stuff to allow people to join online games. Hotseat or live are run locally, but you still want to save a file for people to access, in case they need to change machines, their current one restarts, etc.

2a. If it's an online game, the host decides the rules, name of the game, etc, and joins the game himself. The game begins when he's ready. The guest can only join and wait for the host to do something.
2b. If it's a local game, the host decides the rules, agents, name of the game, and the game begins as soon as he's done configuring it.
2bÂª. If it's a live game, it is similar to a local game. The main difference is that the live game doesn't directly keep track of player cards.

In any case, the game needs a save file. The save file contains the full state of the game. The $_SESSION only contains your currently loaded game, and perhaps any variables that aren't yet (but are about to be) in the game save file.

// end save file sample

The save file is built when the host goes thru the initial setup process. It can be destroyed by the host, or else it will naturally expire after a set period of time of not being updated, e.g. one week or one month.

After this, the game would consist of reading the save file to determine where things are, processing actions, and reading card powers and exception lists to determine if commands are valid.

1 Build game board - use generic function, and load special game board
